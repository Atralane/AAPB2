# Getting started

- Install [RVM](https://rvm.io/), if you haven't already: `curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`
- Start a new terminal to make the `rvm` command available.
- Clone this repository.
- `cd` to your copy of the repo.
- You may see a message from RVM stating that the required Ruby version is not available. Install it as instructed.
- To get dependencies, `bundle install`.

At this point you could

- run tests
- start rails
- or run a script or rake task.
