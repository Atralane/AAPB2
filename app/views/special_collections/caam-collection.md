## Summary

The *Center for Asian American Media* Collection contains films that speak to the Asian experience though the lens of history. The collection includes early broadcasts by the ground-breaking Asian American anthology series *Silk Screen* (1982-1987); which explores the subject of identity and treatment of Asian Americans in the San Francisco Bay Area. Although the subjects, history, and geography are diverse, the collection as a whole speaks to the complexities of Asian American life, culture, and experiences; evoking the universal struggle and resilience of the human condition. This collection was digitized as part of the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, Public Broadcasting Preservation Fellowship with a partnership of The Bay Area Video Coalition and San José State University.
