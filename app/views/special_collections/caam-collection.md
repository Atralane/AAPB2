## Summary

*The Center for Asian American Media* Collection consists of 23 digital files that contains films that speak to the Asian experience though the lens of history. The collection includes early broadcasts by the ground-break Asian American anthology series *Silk Screen* (1982-1987), which explores identity and treatment of Asian Americans in the San Francisco Bay Area. Although the subjects, history, and geography are diverse, the collection as a whole speaks to the diversity of Asian American life, culture, and experiences; evoking the universal struggle and resilience of the human condition. This collection was digitized as part of the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, Public Broadcasting Preservation Fellowship with a partnership of Bay Area Video Coalition and San Jose State University. 

## Background

audiences to new voices and communities, advancing our collective understanding of
the American experience through programs specifically designed to engage the Asian
American community and the public at large.

## Help

*American Masters* interviews are currently available to view on location at WGBH and the Library of Congress. The interviews are organized by the *American Masters* episode for which each interview was recorded. Each metadata record contains the series and episode titles for the corresponding production, as well as one or more raw footage titles, which contain the names of the individual(s) interviewed in the recording. An interview may span more than one file, and a file may contain multiple interviews. Interviews that span multiple files also span multiple records on the AAPB. To retrieve all interviews conducted for a specific episode, either perform a search of the episode title or locate a record of interest and click the “Episode Title” listed in the metadata record. The best way to find an interview with a specific individual is to keyword search their last name. If researching a subject, the best strategy is to browse all the raw interview recordings from episodes which concern your research topic. There are currently no descriptions of content or subject terms present in the recordings’ metadata records. There are also no transcripts for the recordings, thus at this time, keyword searching for topics will not yield useful results.
