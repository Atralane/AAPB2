## Summary

The <em>Africans in America </em> series is made up of 53 raw interviews from the 1998 American Experience series of the same name about the experiences of African people and their transformation of America. The series begins with 16th century enslavement on Africa's Gold Coast and ends on the eve of the American Civil War in 1861. Interviews offer an in-depth examination of the social, economic, and intellectual foundations of American slavery and the ways in which African people changed America. Guests include authors, professors, historians, and statesmen, including Colin Powell, retired four-star general and the first African American on the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Karen Hughes White, a descendant of Thomas Jefferson and founder of the Afro-American Historical Association of Fauquier County; Catherine Acholonu, a Nigerian author and Associate Professor of English Literature, Awuku College of Education; and Jeffrey Leath, Paster of Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church, Philadelphia. Topics range from English Protestantism, George Washington, Toussaint Louverture, the American Revolution, Nat Turner's Rebellion, gender conventions, racism, Christianity, violence, economics, family, and enslavement. 

## Background

The <em>Woman</em> Series was contributed to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) by WNED during the first major AAPB digitization project funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 2012. Once digitized, the show’s producer and host Sandra Elkin assisted AAPB archivists in cataloging the digitized collection.
