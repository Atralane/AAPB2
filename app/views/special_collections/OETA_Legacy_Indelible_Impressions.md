\pard\widctlpar\sa160\sl276\slmult1 <em>OETA Legacy Indelible Impressions</em> Collection \cf0 showcases the history of Oklahoma previously identified as Indian Territory prior to statehood.  It is a glimpse into the past, covering topics and exploring issues that are relevant to the diverse cultures represented, both then and now. Issues such as racial diversity, terrorism, natural disasters, war, and poverty become the catalyst for unity and the impetus for exploration, growth, and acceptance. This collection is an eclectic mix of at-risk public media material from the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority (OETA) Archive with contributions from the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation Archive. At the heart of this collection, are the people. The resilient men and women who have both contributed to the legacy of Oklahoma as well as the mosaic of our great nation in the area of art, music, science, exploration, politics, religion, architecture, literature, language, etc. Oklahoma Legacy is a culmination of indelible impressions of perseverance, fortitude, resilience and pride. This collection was digitized as part of the Public Broadcasting Preservation Fellowship in collaboration with Oklahoma Educational Television Authority. \par

\cf0\highlight2 The Oklahoma Educational Television Authority is Oklahoma's only statewide coordinated instructional and public television network. In 1951 the state legislature pioneered the growth of noncommercial educational television in the United States by unanimously approving House Concurrent Resolution Number 5, urging the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reserve television channels for educational purposes. In addition to offering television programs supplied by PBS and acquired from various independent distributors, the network produces news,\~{\highlight0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_affairs_(broadcasting)"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\highlight2 public affairs}}}}\f0\fs20 , cultural, and documentary programming; the OETA also distributes online education programs for classroom use and teacher professional development, and maintains the state's\~{\highlight0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Emergency_Alerts"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\highlight2 Warning, Alert and Response Network}}}}\f0\fs20\~(WARN) infrastructure.
