## Summary

The <em>Jubilee Singers: Sacrifice and Glory</em> interviews are a series of nineteen interviews conducted in 2000 for the <em>American Experience</em> program of the same name. The program focused on the early years of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, an ensemble of students at Fisk University in Tennessee who created the <em>a capella</em> group in 1871 in an effort to raise funds for the financially-struggling school. The Fisk Jubilee Singers, largely made up of former slaves, toured around the United States, and, later, Europe, and were known for their performances of spirituals, which they are partially credited with preserving and introducing to a wider audience. Although their success came at great personal cost, Fisk University and the Fisk Jubilee Singers continue to thrive today, as a result of the resounding success of the original Jubilee Singers. Interviews were conducted with musicologists and historians, including John Hope Franklin, historian and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom; Toni Anderson, Music Historian; Horace Clarence Boyer, musicologist and noted scholar of African-American gospel music; and Reavis L. Mitchell, Professor of History at Fisk University. Topics include music, slavery, higher education, HBCUs and Fisk University, spirituals, religion, segregation, the American Civil War, and racism.
