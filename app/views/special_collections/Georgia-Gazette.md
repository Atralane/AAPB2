## Summary

Along side the weekly show, the <em>Georgia Gazette</em> team also produced an hour long monthly call-in program called Georgia Gazette Consumer Call-In The main host of <em>Georgia Gazette</em> was Bruce Dortin. <em>Georgia Gazette</em> is thought to be the longest running Georgia focused radio program in the country. Each episode focused on a variety of topics with reporting from all across the state. Georgia legislative issues and political happenings were covered as well as current arts and sports events. Guests often included well-known and lesser-known Georgia writers, comedians, journalists, scholars, lawyers, artists, psychologists, and doctors.

The Georgia Gazette Consumer Call-In program focused on the single topic of consumer rights. From time to time the program focused on a particular consumer issue such as auto recalls. Guests on the program were the Secretary of the State of Georgia Lewis Massey and later, Cathy Cox as well as representatives from the Governors Office of Consumer Affairs, Berry Reed and Trilis Halford. During this program Georgians could call in and get help and advice directly from the experts about their consumer issues. 

## Background
