# Protesting in the 1960s and 1970

## Summary

When discussing the role of protest in America, it seems only fitting to begin in the 1960s. The decade that began with the protests of the Civil Rights Movement would end in a wave of activism by students, marginalized communities, and women that continued into the mid 1970s. As one historian put it,


#### “In the 1960s, dissents shook the very foundation of U.S. civil society.”[<sup>3</sup>](/exhibits/first-amendment/notes#3)


### The Fight Against Racism and Injustice


The AAPB holds notable audio and video from the Civil Rights Movement, which began in the 1950s and reached the peak of its activism in the mid-1960s. Commentary from [Rosa Parks](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-kw57d2qp45), audio from members of the [Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-br8mc8rr6z) and [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-sj19k46b34), interviewers with members of [Southern Christian Leadership Conference](/catalog/cpb-aacip/15-95q4rk9v), and radio programs describing [stay-outs](/catalog/cpb-aacip/15-9v698c0j) vividly show the organized resistance to discrimination and the use of protest during the Civil Rights Movement. Another AAPB exhibit, [Voices from the Southern Civil Rights Movement](http://americanarchive.org/exhibits/civil-rights), provides an in-depth examination of the movement in the American south.


During the mid-1960s, a new strategy and philosophy to improve black lives grew out of the Civil Rights Movement. The Black Power movement, espoused by organizations like SNCC and Oakland’s Black Panther Party, began to advocate and rally in favor of black pride, black liberation, and revolutionary determinism. Pieces like [Sproul Hall sit-in documentation (1968)](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-kw57d2qp5g), [Rally for the Oakland Seven (1968)](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-ft8df6kf9j), and [Cecil Williams and Angela Davis Speaks (1972)](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-833mw28n8t)  document these protests as well as show their intersection with the rise of the “New Left” and student radicalism.

The Red Power movement and the Chicano movement also fought against racism and sought to renew ethnic pride during the turbulent decades of the 1960s and 1970s. The Red Power movement was an inter-tribal movement by Americans Indians that fought for self-determination, sovereignty, and better reservation conditions during the late 1960s and the 1970s. The AAPB contains two pivotal moments of the Red Power in its archives: the occupation of [Alcatraz Island in 1969](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-q23qv3cj2p) and [the Longest Walk in 1978](/catalog/cpb-aacip/43-84zgn7fb). These two protests highlighted the concerns of American Indians to the public through acts of civil disobedience and mass protest. The Chicano Movement also began in this period, fighting for better [labor conditions](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-j09w08ws8t), [against racism](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-6t0gt5fp55), and seeking to celebrate Mexican-American heritage.

### The New Left: Students Protests, Vietnam, and Women’s Liberation


The growth of the New Left and student radicalism began in the early 1960s and reached the height of its activism during 1968. This new political movement sprouted protests on college campuses from the [East Coast](/catalog/cpb-aacip/305-89r22j6z) to the [West Coast](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-kw57d2qp5g) on issues including the Vietnam War, free speech, the environment, and racism. Including student groups like Students for a Democratic Society and the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley, radical student groups rallied for the “common struggle with the liberation movements of the world.”[<sup>4</sup>](/exhibits/first-amendment/notes#4)


Likewise rooted in the New Left, the women’s liberation movement gained renewed energy and force in the late 1960s and early 1970s as women fought for equal pay, equal treatment, and new opportunities. A vivid piece of this history is found in this recording of a [1973 celebration](/catalog/cpb-aacip/27-j678s4k46n) of International Women’s Day, while a recording of this 1970s era rally shows women in action to gain important [child care support](/catalog/cpb-aacip/43-hx15m62n07).


Protests against the war in Vietnam loomed large in New Left activities, drawing crowds of students, non-students, radicals, and moderates who agreed that the conflict should end. Protests against the Vietnam War began to gain prominence in 1965 on college campuses and gained national attention in the following two years when Civil Rights leaders, like Martin Luther King Jr., joined in anti-war protests. In an anti-war protest in April of 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. and other members of a broad coalition called Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam helped to lead [a march of 300,000](/catalog/cpb-aacip/15-hd7np1wp9x) anti-war protesters in New York City. Black and hispanic community leaders, in events like the [Chicano Moratorium](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-6t0gt5fp55), also protested that the war had a greater impact in terms of deaths and suffering on their communities.

In fall of 1967, over 1,000 student protesters returned their draft cards at the steps of the Justice Department. It was the beginning of over 25,000 draft cards burnt, returned, or destroyed in protest during the course of the war. [Recounting in 1982](/catalog/cpb-aacip/15-9k45q4rs29 ) his own role in this act of civil disobedience, Rev. William Sloane Coffin of Yale remarked, “My own feeling was that this war was so wrong that having done all the other things I just felt I would have to commit civil disobedience. Now, it’s not an easy thing to do if you’re married and if you have small children…[But] I felt sort of a wider parish of students were turning in their draft cards. And what was their chaplain going to do? And the obvious thing was that the pastor should stand by his parishioners.”

#### “I just felt I would have to commit civil disobedience.”

By the fall of 1967, only 35 percent of Americans supported U.S. policies in Vietnam.[<sup>5</sup>](/exhibits/first-amendment/notes#5) And during 1968, the anti-war movement only gained in momentum and fervor. In particular, the Democratic Party felt the effects of anti-war sentiment, swiftly becoming increasingly divided over the war. During the [1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago](/catalog/cpb-aacip/15-ms3jw86w23), a stand-off between anti-war protesters and police erupted in violence as police brutally and indiscriminately used force against the crowds gathered to protest the Democratic nominee.

From 1968 to 1970, protests continued in force as events like the Tet Offensive, My Lai massacre, and the Kent State Massacre led individuals to further protest the role of the United States in Vietnam. The last event—in which National Guardsmen shot and killed four Kent State students at an anti-war protest—led to a nationwide student strike that shut down 500 colleges. As one historian put it, “By January 1973, when Nixon announced the effective end of U.S. involvement [in Vietnam], he did so in response to a mandate unequaled in modern times."[<sup>6</sup>](/exhibits/first-amendment/notes#6)
