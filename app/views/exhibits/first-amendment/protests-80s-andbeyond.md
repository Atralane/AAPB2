# Protesting in 1980s and Beyond 


While not as ubiquitous as the decades of the 1960s and 1970s, protesting in the 1980s and beyond has continued to play an important role in American life. 


The AAPB’s collection highlights some of the issues of the past three decades. It shows the growth of the environmental movement, kick-started by publication of *Silent Spring* in 1962 and growing exponentially in the following decades. These two clips show protests against [logging](/catalog/cpb-aacip/426-78gf23fs) and against [trash incinerators](/catalog/cpb-aacip/375-28ncjz41) by a national organization and a small local community, showcasing the diversity and unity of a movement seeking to preserve the earth and protect our health against the hazards of pollutants.

The AAPB also holds footage of continued protests against racism and injustice. Watch as [devoted New Yorkers](/catalog/cpb-aacip/75-171vhp1s) protest on behalf of Muslim immigrants held without charges in the aftermath of 9/11. See raw footage of a [2006 march for immigrant rights](/catalog/cpb-aacip/86-12z34x02) , where participants advocated for better immigration policies and treatment. Or check out a former president rallying for increased representation—see if you can spot a young Barack Obama speaking out against the underrepresentation of black professors at Harvard Law School at this rally.


Political divisive issues also come to the forefront, as the AAPB holds footage of protests and rallies seeking to improve the [farming economy](/catalog/cpb-aacip/37-870vtg28), tighten [gun control](/catalog/cpb-aacip/398-85n8pwxp), display [erotic art](/catalog/cpb-aacip/15-086348gg8n), as well as two opposing protests on the [impeachment of Bill Clinton](/catalog/cpb-aacip/153-46254f1d).

New technology has revolutionized the revolutionaries, social activists, and concerned citizens among us. In this panel on “[Social Media and Social Change](/catalog/cpb-aacip/15-tx3513v769),” LGBTQ advocates discuss how they employ social media to grow their movements and further social change. Likewise, new technology in the form of smartphone cameras has given almost anyone the ability to document protests and activism, making protests more and more present in American life.
