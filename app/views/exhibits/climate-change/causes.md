## Summary

Greenhouse gases, such as carbon and methane, are gases that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, adding additional energy and making the planet warmer. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, human activities have been the source of almost all greenhouse gas emissions, which has taken place primarily through the burning of fossil fuels. Statistics show that the United States is responsible for ??% of fossil fuel production, while China is responsible for ??%; however, much of the emissions in China are traced to out-sourced United States manufacturing and industry corporations. Greenhouse gases are emitted through electricity production, transportation, industry and manufacturing, heating our homes and business, waste management, agriculture, and forestry. In addition, once the climate begins to change, it sets into effect positive feedback loops, that is, initial warming accelerates the warming trend in a vicious cycle. One example of a positive feedback loop is the melting of ice. Ice helps reflect heat from being absorbed into the atmosphere. Once it begins to melt, it turns dark, and the energy is absorbed, which leads to more warming. 

Throughout this exhibit, you may notice that scientists and activists, each of whom talk about the various facets of climate change, from a policy perspective to activism to specific research on impacts and solutions, spent a portion of their discussions communicating that climate change is happening and its causes. Even though the scientific consensus on human-driven climate change has been steady for more than two decades, it is interesting to note that they felt the need to communicate the basic principle before diving into the heart of their talk. This may be attributed to the fact that public perception to this day is that climate change is not an urgent issue for much of the American public.

The two items in this section of the exhibit are unique in their focus on causes. One, an edited documentary titled "After the Warming" which originally broadcast in 1990 by Maryland Public Television, looks at the causes of climate change from the year 2050. The second, a public lecture by Anna Lappe, focuses on an often-overlooked cause of climate change -- our food, livestock and agricultural industries.
