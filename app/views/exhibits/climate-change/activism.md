## Summary

Since the late 1980s, writer and climate change activist Bill McKibben has been the leading voice on global warming. Over the course of his career, he has discussed on multiple occasions the issue of climate change over the airwaves of public radio and television. His first book published in 1989 titled "The End of Nature" argued for a transformational shift in how society perceives our relationship of domination with the Earth. By the time he published his latest book "Eaarth," people across the world had already begun to feel the impacts of climate change. McKibben writes that we no longer live on the same planet. The unprecedented amount of carbon and fossil fuel emissions in our atmosphere have fundamentally altered the planet; now, he argues, we must learn to adapt and live on this new planet. 

A study published by Yale University and George Mason University in 2014 reports that only 13% of Americans are "alarmed" about climate change. This group of people is the most concerned and most motivated to take action. According to writer and climate activist George Marshall, who wrote "Don't Even Think about It: Why our Brains are Wired to Ignore Climate Change," for most people, the distant threat of climate change does not feel urgent, and therefore they are not reactive to it. Climate change activists have worked to raise awareness of the threats and impacts of climate change, some of which have used public broadcasting as their medium. 

In 2008, McKibben and a group of college students founded 350.org, a grassroots effort to mobilize citizens across the world to take action on climate change. Because more than 4,000 languages are spoken across the globe, the universally understood number "350," which, according to Dr. James Hansen, is the safe upper limit of carbon dioxide parts per million in the atmosphere, became the name of the organization. Today, 350 works in every country to effect change on both the local and global scale, and activists around the world have dedicated themselves to the effort.
