## Summary

Some artists have taken to addressing the issue of climate change through their artwork, from basket-weaving to documentary filmmaking. A challenge in artistic methods of communicating climate change is the difficulty in telling a compelling, engaging story that will resonate with audiences while effectively communicating the technical and scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change. But it is a challenge accepted by artists like Nathalie Miebach and mockumentary filmmaker Randy Olsen. On communicating climate change through sculpture and basket-weaving, Miebach said in a public lecture on WGBH Forum Network that she is "trying to explore the kind of expectations that we bring with us when we try to address a question either through science or through art, and how this visualization influences the way we understanding something."
