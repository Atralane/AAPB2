## Summary

As concern about the environment grew among scientists in the mid-1950s, they began to measure the Earth's carbon dioxide levels at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii in 1958. "Human beings are now carrying out a large-scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future," said Roger Revelle of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In 1962, Rachel Carson, now regarded as the mother of the environmental movement, published Silent Spring, calling the environment to the attention of the public and leading President Kennedy to establish a Science Advisory Committee to investigate environmental dangers such as DDT. The first Earth Day celebrated on April 22, 1970 launched what is known as the "environmental decade," and grassroots activists paved the way for the groundbreaking environmental legislation such as the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. 

Environmental problems in the 1970s, including air and water pollution, were local, visible, and issues that personally impacted many American citizens. Global climate change, according to Dr. Gus Speth when interviewed by WILL in 2004, is more subtle, more technical, and harder to get one's head around. Climate scientists and activists face a much more difficult challenge of communicating climate change to the general public. 

But perceptions are changing, and people are becoming more aware of the problem. In North America, Europe and Japan, more than 90% of the public are aware of climate change; however, this sharply contrasts with the global percentage, where as much as 40% of adults worldwide have never heard of climate change.
