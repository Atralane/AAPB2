## Summary

Scientists and policy makers have over the years discussed possible solutions to climate change over the airwaves of public broadcasting. To address and mitigate the impacts of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in 2014 that the United States and other polluting countries must come together to implement a global strategy to dramatically reduce fossil fuel emissions as much as 80% by 2050, and eventually eliminate them altogether. According to researchers with the Sustainable Development Solutions Network's and the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations' Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project, this can be done using existing or near-commercial technologies. With the reduction of the use of fossil fuels, countries will need to make large investments in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. 

Policy makers have historically put off and delayed any global binding agreements to reduce emissions. In 1997, 83 countries, not including the United States, signed the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty committing countries to modest greenhouse gas reductions. This treaty had only slight effects to curbing emissions; according to a study published in 2014 by the French climate research group Caisse des Depots (CDC), ten years after the Kyoto Protocol was signed, world emissions had actually increased by 24%. In 2009, world leaders met in Copenhagen, Denmark to develop a more effective and comprehensive strategy for making greater commitments to reduce emissions on a global scale. This summit is often considered a failure among scientists and activists, since no target emissions reduction was agreed upon or executed following the summit. In December 2015, world leaders from the United Nations will convene again for the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21), with the goal of reaching a universal agreement and plan for emissions reductions. 

Decades ago, climate change could have been prevented. By now, it is inevitable and has already begun to take its toll on countries around the world. The impacts of sea-level rise, more frequent and severe weather and heat waves, and longer wildfire seasons now need to be confronted, countries and local communities will need to adapt to the new normal of our changed planet.
