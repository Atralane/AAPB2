## Summary
### Featured Program: Diary of a Student Revolution
The program opens with a close shot of an on-campus recruitment meeting. Cut to a young man who says, “The system cannot be tolerated and must be destroyed.” Now the university president says,

<blockquote>The only people who concern me, who cause me any anxiety at all, are the people who I think are, in fact, determined to destroy an institution. Who, it seems to me, are prepared to say that because a hospital doesn’t save the life of everybody who comes into the hospital, we should burn the hospital down.</blockquote>

So begins the [*Diary of a Student Revolution*](/catalog/cpb-aacip_), produced and written by Morton Silverstein and aired on NET Journal in March 1969. Film crews spent ten days at the University of Connecticut in December 1968 as protests surrounding on-campus recruiting by military contractors Dow Chemical and Olin Mathieson threatened to disrupt the last weeks before winter break. One crew followed the UConn branch of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) while another monitored University President Homer D. Babbidge, Jr. In the spliced final cut, the viewer can see reactions to events on both sides of the battle simultaneously. With minimal narration, the documentary presents state police reading the riot act to SDS protestors, a meeting of the UConn student congress, an SDS planning session, and deliberations in Babbidge’s office. The viewer sees a counter-protest where one student announces to a large crowd, “We believe that the majority of students on this campus oppose the tactics of a minority” to hearty applause, while a sobbing young woman in the crowd wails, “You’re not listening. Nobody ever does anything.” In a lecture hall, sign-wielding SDS members disrupt a class, while students in the lecture hall yell for them to leave. In a closing comment, Babbidge, resignedly, says, “I think probably we’re in for a fairly long siege.” Generalizations about “campus unrest” in the 1960s melt away before the intimate portrait of one university grappling with its identity and purpose.

### Introduction

In the years before the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) were created, public television was dominated by NET, or National Educational Television. NET began as the Educational Television and Radio Center (ETRC), a non-profit corporation organized to execute the administrative task of sharing content produced by educational broadcasters across the country. After 1958, however, NET increasingly sought to make itself into a “Fourth Network,” one that could join the ranks of ABC, NBC, and CBS. NET’s leaders believed that they could eke out a niche by producing and airing public affairs content, especially documentaries. Over the course of the 1960s, NET dove into hot-button education-related issues confronting local communities, such as desegregation in urban schools and unrest on college campuses.

<a id="A-University-on-the-Air"></a>

### “A University on the Air”: Educational Television, 1953-1964

At the outset, educational television was almost entirely funded by the Ford Foundation’s Fund for Adult Education (FAE). Robert Hudson, FAE’s media consultant who became ETRC’s head of programming, described the Center as “an educational institution whose mode of expression was television.” Its purpose was “to inform, to educate, and to enrich the lives of viewers.”  Beginning in May 1954, the Center began sending the four local stations then in operation program packages to air. This practice expanded as new local stations joined the consortium and the Center built the capacity to distribute more material. Stations readily accepted the programming because most could only afford to be on the air about forty hours a week and relied upon ETRC-sourced content.  Since the stations had no electronic interconnection capabilities—the means of transmitting programs live through telephone wires—these programs had to be copied onto film that was then rotated from station to station through the mail.

Public television programming in its early years could hardly be described as exciting. ETRC remained true to the “university on the air” model developed during the educational radio years.  John White, who became the Center’s president in 1958, described the early programming as “a succession of gray professors in front of gray drapes delivering gray and dusty lectures.”  White was determined to add some life to public television. He began by moving the Center from its original location in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to New York and changing its name to the National Educational Television and Radio Center (soon to be shortened to NET). In 1961, NET began producing “NET Prime Time” three nights a week between 7:30-10:00, which 90% of affiliates chose to air.

Much of the content distributed to local stations fell under the category of “public affairs,” in accordance with directives from the Ford Foundation. Between 1958 and 1962, the number of documentaries shown on public television doubled, mimicking the news content on the three networks.  But after 1963, the networks increasingly turned toward lighter programming like westerns and comedies, allowing NET to make documentaries an essential part of their brand.

In November 1964, the White Administration released the *N.E.T. Program Philosophy and Purpose*, which declared these goals for their public affairs programming,

<blockquote>- To induce people to think critically about the important national and international issues confronting our society and, having thought, to act intelligently and democratically toward the resolution of these issues.
  
- To help develop an informed, alert, active citizenry, jealous of its freedoms and conscious of its responsibilities.
</blockquote>

These ambitious goals led to a collection of compelling documentaries in the latter half of the 1960s.


<a id="Milestones-in-Education"></a>

### Milestones in Education, 1954-1968
The federal government expanded its role in public education over the course of the 1950s. After the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite in 1957, American politicians feared that American education, as it stood, was insufficient to develop minds bright enough to rival the Russians. Congress passed the National Defense Education Act (NDEA), which put millions of dollars toward preparing top students for careers in the sciences and foreign languages.  Leaders in educational television welcomed the increased focus on learning since it improved educational television’s initially lukewarm status. James Day of KQED noted, “With the sudden realization that our curricula were dangerously deficient in science and math and that years would be required to train teachers, the new technology of television seemed a fortuitous blessing.”

In 1954, the Supreme Court had handed down the *Brown v. Board* decision that struck down *de jure* segregation in public schools, declaring that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.”  Local districts responded so slowly to this mandate, however, that little changed until the Johnson administration arrived in Washington.  Large shifts in public education began with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which permitted the Department of Justice to sue segregated school districts.  Next, the Johnson administration passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which increased Washington’s role in setting standards for state educational agencies and public schools. This signature piece of Great Society legislation focused on “compensatory education,” providing additional resources for students at risk of low educational achievement, as President Lyndon Johnson remarked on signing the legislation, “As a son of a tenant farmer, I know that education is the only valid passport from poverty.”  These actions, combined with the prodigious efforts of civil rights activists fighting for quality education in their localities, put pressure on school systems in both the North and South to fundamentally restructure. As Ira Katznelson and Margaret Weir have noted, “since their founding, public schools in large U.S. cities have been neighborhood and community institutions.”  Now, local school districts were subject to the demands of their communities, the courts, and the federal government. After the Civil Rights Act, these demands were mostly for racial integration, ending de jure segregation in the South and *de facto* segregation in the North.

As the decade proceeded, civil rights activists grew frustrated with the failures of desegregation. Influenced by the Black Power movement, many black parents and activists began rallying for “community control” of schools—“decentralization,” rather than integration. Most famously, in 1967, the Ocean Hill-Brownsville neighborhood in Brooklyn gained local governance over their schools. The experiment ended in 1969 after two years of strikes, demonstrations, and battles between locals, the teachers union, and the New York City bureaucracy.  All told, the demands put on schools, teachers, and students in the 1960s were high. Through it all, educational television attempted to keep pace.

The public hearings began on May 17, 1973, with [opening statements](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-6688g8g717#at_385.00_s) from the senators and the testimony of one [Robert Odle](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-6688g8g717#at_2398.00_s). Sam Dash, a law professor from Georgetown, was adamant that the Committee build its investigation with “small fish” before moving on to the “star witnesses” of Nixon’s inner circle. As a result, the two witnesses on the first day, Robert Odle and [Bruce Kehrli](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-5d8nc5t09z#at_3538.00_s), were low-rankers who explained the chains of command at CREEP and the White House, respectively. The next witnesses, [Sergeant Paul Leeper](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-pr7mp4wh9w#at_3530.00_s), [Officer Carl Shoffler](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-d795718g4z#at_720.00_s), [James McCord](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-445h99017v#at_770.00_s), [Bernard Barker](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-6w96689903#at_4956.00_s), and [Alfred Baldwin](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-1v5bc3tj5x#at_1310.00_s), reported on the events of the break-in at the Watergate and CREEP bugging operations. With [James Caulfield](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-xk84j0c06r#at_820.00_s), [Anthony Ulasewicz](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-p55db7wm55#at_1620.00_s), [Sally Harmony](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-4m91834s7x#at_770.00_s), and [Robert Reisner](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-6q1sf2n01g#at_3196.00_), the Committee moved into investigating the cover-up including offers of executive clemency, destroyed files, and cash payments. [Hugh Sloan](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-x921c1vj3c#at_913.00_s), [Herbert Porter](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-s17sn0210s#at_3494.00_s), and [Maurice Stans](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-qb9v11wf48#at_434.00_s) then described their roles in securing and distributing money for the burglars and their families. The first witness on a higher tier of importance was [Jeb Stuart Magruder](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-bz6154fh47#at_508.00_s), the former deputy director of CREEP, who implicated many more people, including his boss, John Mitchell, and admitted to developing a considerable portion of the cover-up.

The first moment of substantial drama came with the testimony of [John Dean](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-125q815b4c#at_18.00_s), which subsequently became the standard against which all other testimony was judged.[<sup>16</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#16)  In a calm, steady manner that belied the shocking information he revealed, Dean claimed that the President of the United States was involved in the cover-up as early as September 1972.[<sup>17</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#17)  Senator Inouye later [commented](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-mc8rb6ww1z#at_2977.00_s) that he thought that no one believed Dean at first as “it was too fantastic.” As his testimony went on, Dean revealed more and more information about White House practices, including improper use of the IRS and campaign funds, the “enemies list,” and surveillance of politicians. But after five days of questioning, the Committee had done little to crack his opening statement regarding the President.[<sup>18</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#18)

The next two witnesses, former Attorney General and director of CREEP [John Mitchell](/catalog/cpb-aacip_q23qv3d02h) and special counsel [Richard Moore](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-4j09w09n39#at_460.00_s), both contradicted Dean’s testimony, unequivocally stating that the President had no knowledge of Watergate until late March 1973. The two left the Committee in an apparent state of gridlock. [At the end of the July 13 broadcast, Lehrer asked](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-jh3cz33054#at_1687.00_s),

<blockquote> Isn’t the Committee walking itself out onto a plank? How are they ever really going to resolve the question (of Nixon’s guilt) when you continue to have witnesses like Mitchell and Moore, compared to Dean and Magruder, and all of these many, many things, where there’s no way to resolve them!</blockquote>

The very next public hearing, in a moment of dramatic irony, that question was answered. On Monday July 16, the Committee brought out a surprise witness, the unknown former aide [Alexander Butterfield](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-jm23b5x51c#at_3084.00_s), who without flair or showmanship reported that Nixon had recorded all his conversations in the Oval Office. The Committee voted in executive session to request access to the tapes.[<sup>19</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#19)  The ensuing excitement over the tapes overshadowed the next few witnesses, [Herbert Kalmbach](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-df6k06xs20#at_697.00_s), [Fred LaRue](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-8p5v699118#at_3690.00_s), [Robert Mardian](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-rx93776v6t#at_2286.00_s), and Gordon Strachan, who elaborated on the distribution of money, the cover-up, and the dirty tricks of CREEP and the White House. [On July 23, as Robert MacNeil reported](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-qf8jd4qk7g#at_142.00_s), “Watergate moved from the realm of political scandal to political crisis” after Nixon refused to hand over the tapes and the Committee voted unanimously to serve two subpoenas, the first time Congress had subpoenaed a sitting President.

With the problem of the tapes continuing to hang over the Committee room, the senators moved on to their originally planned “star witnesses”: [John Ehrlichman](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-t43hx16p65#at_627.00_s) and [H. R. (Bob) Haldeman](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-4f1mg7gg9h#at_1424.00_s), two of Nixon’s closest friends and advisors. [Dash later commented](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-gm81j9840b#at_787.00_s), “John Ehrlichman came with his jaw strutting out, saying who are you to call me to account, I did everything for my President and my country and I was right. And he put the Committee on the defense.” Haldeman, who had a reputation for harsh leadership (“Every President has his SOB and I’m Richard Nixon’s”), surprisingly came in docile and willing to help. Regardless of their respective personalities, both denied that they or President Nixon had done anything wrong. Haldeman added another wrinkle to the tapes battle when he reported that Nixon had allowed him to listen to some of the tapes at home after he had resigned, thereby undermining the validity of any claims of executive privilege. After Ehrlichman and Haldeman, the Committee retreated from White House insiders to fill in gaps in the existing testimony. They began with current and former intelligence officials, [Richard Helms](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-930ns0mm7k#at_750.00_s), [Robert Cushman](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-m03xs5k89r#at_2260.00_s), and [Vernon Walters](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-sj19k46s2d#at_613.00_s) of the CIA, and [L. Patrick Gray](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-qv3bz6261n#at_3390.00_s), former acting director of the FBI. [Richard Kleindienst](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-3n20c4t866#at_735.00_s) and Assistant Attorney General [Henry Petersen](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-vh5cc0vt0g#at_1645.00_s) rounded out the investigation before the August break.

#### Phase Two: "Dirty Tricks"

</table>

The Committee reopened its doors to the public on September 24, but in a manner that left many, including a few senators, feeling that the Committee had lost its purpose. The intended topic of investigation, improper campaign practices, or so-called “dirty tricks” seemed like small potatoes compared to the ongoing constitutional crisis precipitated by the tapes. Despite these concerns, the Committee plowed on. The first witness upon their return was [E. Howard Hunt](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-hh6c24rg76#at_690.00_s), who rounded out phase one before the Committee moved on to phase two with [Pat Buchanan](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-kk94747p23#at_420.00_s), Nixon’s speechwriter and ideological advisor. The main witness, [Donald Segretti](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-k93125r708#at_360.00_s), who along with Charles Colson had planned CREEP’s tricks against the Democrats, described and apologized for many of his actions. Two of his assistants, [Martin Douglas Kelly](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-v69862cb8n#at_323.00_s) and [Robert Benz](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-tm71v5cf4r#at_2340.00_s), corroborated his testimony. The next two men to testify, [John Buckley](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-b27pn8z459#at_855.00_s) and [Michael McMinoway](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-xs5j96193p#at_420.00_s), were undercover operatives in the Muskie and McGovern campaigns, respectively. The following several witnesses, [Frederick Taugher](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-fq9q23rr49#at_1938.00_s), [Kenneth Hickman](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-ks6j09wz71#at_2625.00_s), [Richard Stearns](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-zw18k75z7f#at_589.00_s), and [Frank Mankiewicz](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-959c53fs02#at_656.00_s), testified about possible malfeasance by the McGovern campaign, including a violent demonstration. November 6 included five more testimonies in public session and 30 affidavits introduced into the record detailing various other campaign pranks.

<a id="Phase-Three"></a>

#### Phase Three: "Campaign Finance"
The last phase of the hearings covered donations to the Nixon campaign that might have involved either *quid pro quo* deals or pressure for favorable legislation. Energy during this period was at an all-time low, as both the public and the senators focused their attention elsewhere. Stephen Hess, a frequent expert featured on NPACT’s broadcasts [commented](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-zk55d8ph3z#at_2706.00_s) that the lack of interest was a shame as the Committee could most affect change with new campaign finance legislation.[<sup>20</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#20)  To help illuminate the problem of ethical campaign contributions, [William Marumoto](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-cv4bn9xv8x#at_690.00_s), [John Priestes](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-1g0ht2gx69#at_2195.00_s), and [Benjamin Fernandez](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-7p8tb0zh1p#at_432.00_s) reported on possible *quid pro quo* contributions. Then a representative sample of corporation officials came forward to say that they had been pressured to donate money to the Nixon campaign in exchange for legislative favors. The hearings closed on November 15.

<a id="The-Road-to-Resignation"></a>

### The Road to Resignation: Nixon’s Last Months
While the Senate Committee had been diligently detailing the crimes and misdemeanors of campaign men, the case against Nixon had been rapidly building. On October 20, 1973, Nixon’s orders to fire the special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, resulted in the resignation of the Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy William Ruckelshaus, who refused to carry out the action. Cox was eventually fired as well. This “Saturday Night Massacre,” as it came to be called turned public opinion further against the President.[<sup>21</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#21)  It also prompted Congress to authorize the House Judiciary Committee to investigate Nixon’s crimes.

Reacting to the public uproar for firing Cox, Nixon chose to hand over the tapes that Cox had requested to Judge Sirica. This led to yet another scandal. On November 26, personal secretary to the President Rose Mary Woods testified to causing some of a mysterious 18 ½ minute gap [no one admited to causing the rest of it] on the recording of a key Watergate conversation between Nixon and Haldeman. On December 6, Congress confirmed Gerald Ford as Vice President to replace Spiro Agnew, who had resigned in October after charges of corruption.[<sup>22</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#22)

Nixon had hoped that by handing over the relatively few tapes that Cox had requested, the desire for tapes would stop. Instead there were three bodies, the Senate Watergate Committee, the new Special Prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, and the House Judiciary Committee, interested in the tapes and they all wanted more. On November 27, the leaders of the Senate Watergate investigation committee decided to delay further hearings until after the Christmas break. On January 4, 1974, the President again refused to give the Committee tapes or honor their subpoenas. After two more sets of delays, on February 19, the Committee voted unanimously to hold no more hearings, allowing the country to focus on the special prosecutor.[<sup>23</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#23)

Jaworski “proved to be as tenacious a prosecutor as Cox,” sentencing seven of the President’s men to prison while continuing to pursue more tapes.[<sup>24</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#24)  On April 30, Nixon released edited transcripts of some of them, rife with holes and “expletive deleted” redactions. Judge Sirica, knowing the transcripts to be incomplete, demanded the tapes themselves. When Nixon refused, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear the case in July. These proceedings roused the 38 members of the Judiciary Committee to action. [On May 9, the Committee began hearing evidence](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-nk3610wq1h#at_558.00_s). They voted that day to enter executive session, shutting out the press for the initial stages. In two months, the Committee resurfaced to begin [impeachment debates on July 24](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-gx44q7rk20#at_987.00_s).[<sup>25</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#25)  That day, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Nixon must hand over the tapes to Judge Sirica, which he did after a tense few hours.[<sup>26</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#26)

Nixon’s late compliance could not stop the momentum that after so many months had built to a grand finale. After two days ([July 24](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-gx44q7rk20#at_987.00_s) and [July 25](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-f18sb3xp72)) of speeches from every member of the Committee, it was clear that the majority would vote for impeachment. On [July 26](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-x05x63c309#at_450.00_s), the Committee began discussing specific articles of impeachment, the first of which (obstruction of justice) they approved the next day. On [July 29](/catalog/cpb-aacip_512-cv4bn9xv8x#at_690.00_s), the Committee added “abuses of power” to the first charge. The next day, it added contempt of Congress. During this time, the President’s lawyers were listening to the tapes, including the so-called [“smoking gun” recording](https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/transcripts.php) of a June 23, 1972, conversation between Nixon and Haldeman that revealed that the President had ordered the use of the CIA to obstruct the FBI's investigation of the Watergate break-in. When it became clear he would not survive an impeachment trial, he resigned on August 9, 1974, still unapologetic. For the first time in history, a U.S. president had resigned.[<sup>27</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#27)

<a id="Conclusion"></a>

#### Conclusion: Watergate’s Aftermath
There are a number of ways of viewing the Watergate story. It could be seen as a story of the success of American democracy. [Jim Lehrer later commented](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/covering-watergate-40-years-later-with-macneil-and-lehrer),

>The way I would sum it up is that it’s good news, bad news situation. It showed the government of the United States at its absolute worst and then it showed it at its absolute best. It corrected a wrongdoing, a series of wrongdoings, that was unprecedented. But the way it corrected was also a series of unprecedented doings.[<sup>28</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#28)

Certainly Congress and the Supreme Court, in the method dictated by the Constitution, tried to correct the excesses of an Imperial Presidency and an election system that had gone off the rails, strengthening the Fourth Amendment and privacy protections, reforming campaign financing and giving the Freedom of Information Act real teeth. As Patterson reminds us, “it required a good deal of luck for the ‘system’ to bring him down.”[<sup>29</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#29) Watergate strongly contributed to a wave of American distrust in government and a wave of conspiracy thinking, leaving the lingering question of whether the crimes were simply business as usual. One teacher lamented,

>After Watergate, it’s crazy to have trust in politicians. I’m totally cynical, skeptical. Whether it’s a question of power or influence, it’s who you know at all levels. Nixon said he was the sovereign! Can you believe that? I was indignant. Someone should have told him that this is a democracy, not a monarchy.[<sup>30</sup>](/exhibits/watergate/notes#30)

Watergate was a crucial inflection point in American political history that remains a standard by which to judge presidential corruption and abuse of power.
