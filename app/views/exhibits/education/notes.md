<a name="56"></a><sup>26</sup> Whitehead, interview. Whitehead claimed, though, that while Colson and Haldeman saw public broadcasting “as the enemy politically and were always viscerally prepared” to cut its funding entirely “they never persevered with the political intent to do that.”

<a name="57"></a><sup>57</sup> Whitehead, interview.

<a name="58"></a><sup>58</sup> Memorandum from Whitehead to Peter Flanigan, November, 4, 1969, in *Nixon Papers*, NAEB, 10.

<a name="59"></a><sup>59</sup> Letter from Whitehead to FCC Chairman Dean Burch, November 27, 1970, in *Nixon Papers*, NAEB, 22.

<a name="60"></a><sup>60</sup> Day, *Vanishing Vision*, 216.

<a name="61"></a><sup>61</sup> That Nixon’s advisors were concerned about The Advocates struck some as absurd. One Variety commentator quipped that on The Advocates, “viewers are likely to get two sides of the Adolf Hitler stories and the pros and cons of drug abuse.” Day, *Vanishing Vision*, 216.

<a name="62"></a><sup>62</sup> *Nixon Papers*, NAEB, 25. One aspect of the Nixon Administration’s manipulation of public television that this essay does not highlight because it did not become the central point of controversy is the potential use of the fairness doctrine to make content presented on television more favorable to the Administration. For a discussion of the use of the fairness doctrine to dictate content, among other topics, see Whitehead’s conversation with William F. Buckley on *Firing Line*. In it, Buckley criticizes what he sees as Whitehead’s desire for the government to dictate content. He at one point quips, “You know, that's a little sophistical. It seems to me if you say the speed limit is 50 miles an hour, then you therefore expect people to regulate their speed to 50 miles an hour. But if they don't, you zing them. Right? Now if you say, ‘We don't think that you should countenance elitist gossip,’ are you acting as moralists or are you acting as potential disciplinarians? It would seem to me the latter because you say, ‘What's more, if you don't do as we say, we'll take away your station…People haven't been brought up to take moral injunctions from the Office of Telecommunications.’”  *Firing Line*, “The White House and the Media.”

<a name="63"></a><sup>63</sup> “Memorandum for the President,” draft, June 18, 1971, in *Nixon Papers*, NAEB, 30-32. Another memo sent July 9 advised that the Administration must work hard “to avoid the appearance of hostility to public broadcasting, both because it is a sacred cow in many quarters and because the President’s opponents are already trying to tar him with antagonism towards ‘free and independent’ media.” “Action Memorandum,” sent July 9, 1971, in *Nixon Papers*, NAEB, 32.

<a name="64"></a><sup>64</sup> “Confidential Eyes Only Memorandum,” sent by Jon M. Huntsman to Peter Flanigan, in *Nixon Papers*, NAEB, 36. John Macy later commented that he was baffled by the strength of the President’s response to anything aired on public television. “They viewed us as much more important a force on the American scene than we really were. They had magnified a mouse into a lion. I can’t help but be amused at how exaggerated their estimate of what our strength and influence really was. After all, there weren’t that many people watching.” Stone, *Nixon and Public Television*, 326.

<a name="65"></a><sup>65</sup> Day, *Vanishing Vision*, 213-215. MacNeil later wrote on Vanocur, “I didn't realize until later that he was a lightning rod--a lightning rod that nearly burned down the barn.” MacNeil, *Right Place*, 265.

<a name="66"></a><sup>66</sup> Memorandum from Jon Rose to Larry Higby, October 15, 1971, in *Nixon Papers*, NAEB, 41.

<a name="67"></a><sup>67</sup> “Memorandum for the President,” redrafted October 4, 1971, in *Nixon Papers*, NAEB, 37.

<a name="68"></a><sup>68</sup> One particularly “liberal” program offensive to the Nixon Administration was *Banks and the Poor*, a program distributed for broadcast by NET in November 1970. Stone, *Nixon and Public Television*, 28-35. The financial support of the Ford Foundation was critical to public television in the early years. By the late 1970s, it had invested over $300 million in public media. During this time, the Foundation became synonymous in the Administration for the perceived New York liberal predominance in public television. As a result, Nixon wanted to eliminate its influence. Stone, *Nixon and Public Television*, 5, 24; Memorandum from Albert L. Cole to Richard Nixon, October 27, 1969, in *Nixon Papers*, NAEB, 7.

<a name="69"></a><sup>69</sup> Engelman, *Public Radio and Television*, 168; Day, *Vanishing Vision*, 218. Many, including John Witherspoon, Macy’s lieutenant, were nonplussed by the charge of centralism. Day writes, “They were baffled by his charge that public television had abandoned localism when the charge was clearly contradicted by the facts. If the White House felt the system had not moved far enough, or fast enough, let them find fault within themselves for failing to provide adequate funding.”

<a name="70"></a><sup>70</sup> “Collision of Politics and Public Broadcasting,” *Broadcasting Magazine*, October 25, 1971, 14.

<a name="71"></a><sup>71</sup> Day, *Vanishing Vision*, 216-17. Whitehead later denied that he meant to threaten public broadcasting, but realized the effect it had. “In retrospect, I think it was an ultimatum and I can understand why it was perceived that way.” Whitehead, interview.

<a name="72"></a><sup>72</sup> Letter from Jim Karayn to Whitehead, sent November 4, 1971, in *Nixon Papers*, NAEB, 45.

<a name="73"></a><sup>73</sup> Engelman, *Public Radio and Television*, 168. MacNeil described his experience of censorship from the Nixon Administration in this way: “The mounting political troubles were like distant thunder. We were too busy to pay close attention. Yet we were affected; at the very least I know I was determined not to give the Nixon people any ammunition. That editorial sensitivity was inhibiting but not paralyzing.” MacNeil, *Right Place*, 281.

<a name="74"></a><sup>74</sup> Day, *Vanishing Vision*, 220.

<a name="75"></a><sup>75</sup> Ibid., 222.

<a name="76"></a><sup>76</sup> Memorandum from Whitehead to H. R. Haldeman, November 24, 1972, in *Nixon Papers*, NAEB, 48-49.

<a name="77"></a><sup>77</sup> Day, *Vanishing Vision*, 223.

<a name="78"></a><sup>78</sup> “NAEB Newsletter,” May 10, 1972, in *Nixon Papers*, NAEB, 63-64; Letter from Jim Karayn to Sidney L. James, “RE: NPACT—Where We Stand”, 13 January 1972, Series 2:1, Box 4, Jim Karayn Papers, Special Collections, University of Maryland Libraries. NPACT intended to broacast substantive coverage of the 1972 election that did not come to fruition when its funds were cut. Karayn wrote of his plans in a letter to NPACT’s board: “The weekly series, “A PUBLIC AFFAIR/Election ’72,” which will inevitably be the NPACT showcase, is designed to provide the public with the clearest view yet of the American political process in a Presidential election year. This is NPACT’s most important project. Our success will be reckoned by the extent of its success as a new entry in the 1972 media mix.” He intended the project to have strong pedagogical value that would “look a bit deeper into developing the election issues and the meaningful mechanics of the election process,” rather than just following candidates around the country.
