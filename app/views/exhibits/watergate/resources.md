If you simply can’t get enough of Watergate, there is even more content to watch and read. For the interested visitor, this author recommends the following documentaries and video content: Summer of Judgment (1983), “Covering Watergate: 40 Years Later with MacNeil and Lehrer” (2013), Bill Moyers’s Essay on Watergate (1973), and Dick Cavett’s Watergate (2014). If you, like MacNeil and Lehrer, prefer to draw your own conclusions, both the Nixon Presidential Library and the Ford Presidential Library have extensive online primary source collections including scans of key documents and recordings of the Oval Office tapes. You can also access the full report produced by the Senate Select Committee here.
