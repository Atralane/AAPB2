### Introduction

For many Americans, especially those too young to have lived through its events, the term “Watergate” is more likely to recall a footnote in an US history textbook, or the ubiquitous political suffix than a serious historical epoch with which to engage. Compared to the great successes and wrenching failures in our past, Watergate can feel embarrassing, tawdry, and more worth forgetting than interrogating. This tendency, it seems to many, is a mistake. Historians, journalists, and commentators have advanced many theses for Watergate’s significance, but few for its irrelevance. Some, like James T. Patterson, Bancroft Prize winning author of Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1967, have claimed that Watergate brought on a period of cynicism, ending American post-war ambition. Others have cited Watergate as the height of the “Imperial Presidency,” an expansion of executive power which had grown over the course of the twentieth century.  Watergate, perhaps most importantly, was a “Constitutional Crisis” that left Americans worried the President would overpower both Congress and the Supreme Court. Whether Watergate was a low point of political corruption, a high point in the corrective power of American democracy, or simply the “not with a bang but with a whimper ending to American hegemony,” it was more than just a political scandal.

### What Caused Watergate? 

Watergate, it should first be noted, was a mentality. The tumult of the 1960s and the ever diminishing popularity of the Vietnam War put extreme pressure on the Nixon Administration to bring stability to the nation. These efforts, Nixon felt, were stymied by information leaks, most notably the Pentagon Papers, which other sectors of the government refused to control. As a result, Nixon ordered the formation of the White House Special Investigations Unit, or the “Plumbers,” led by Charles Colson, Nixon’s aide, G. Gordon Liddy, a former FBI agent, and E. Howard Hunt, a former CIA agent.  This team attempted to plug leaks through increasingly illegal and fool hardy plans including a September 1971 break-in to the psychiatrist’s office of Daniel Ellsberg, the man who had leaked the Pentagon Papers, to find incriminating information. The Plumbers unit was only one instantiation of Nixon’s “special passion for vengeance and control,” but it would be the one that got caught.

With the election of 1972 approaching, the White House and the Committee to Reelect the President (CREEP) sought to absolutely guarantee Nixon a second term, refusing to leave anything to chance. What makes this attitude all the more tragic and bemusing is how unnecessary it appears in hindsight. The Democrats destroyed themselves in the 1972 election as first Ted Kennedy and then George Wallace dropped out of the picture. In the primaries, Edmund Muskie and George McGovern worked to discredit each other, leaving McGovern with the nomination, but severely weakened and unpopular among moderate voters. Even so, CREEP solicited campaign contributions in exchange for favorable legislation and team led by Donald Segretti pulled a litany of “dirty tricks” to further discredit the Democratic candidates. Finally the “insatiable appetite for intelligence,” led five burglars to break into the Democratic National Committee headquarters on June 17, 1972 to fix a previously installed bugged telephone. 

To this day, it is not clear whether Nixon knew about the break-in before it occurred, but in many ways it does not matter. As Patterson writes, “In the siege mentality that Nixon incited among his aides, something like Watergate was probably an excess waiting to happen.”  This culture is evident from quotes like the following from Herbert Porter, a former Nixon campaign aide, who on June 7 explained his willingness to commit illegal acts,

>“[M]y loyalty to this man, Richard Nixon, goes back longer than any person that you will see sitting at this table throughout any of these hearings….I first met Mr. Nixon when I was 8 years old in 1948, when he ran for Congress in my home district. I wore Nixon buttons when I was 8 and when I was 10 and when I was 12 and when I was 16. My family worked for him; my father worked for him in campaigns, my mother worked for him in campaigns. I felt as if I had known this man all my life—not personally, perhaps, but in spirit. I felt a deep sense of loyalty to him. I was appealed to on this basis.”

This justification for criminal activity out of loyalty to the President was echoed notably by Jeb Magruder, John Dean, John Mitchell, Bob Haldeman, and John Ehrlichman during their testimony before the Senate Watergate Committee.



<a id="From-Break-in-to-Investigation"></a>

### From the Break-in to the Investigation 
After the burglars were caught in the Watergate, the story went dormant. Throughout the summer and fall of 1972, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein famously kept on the trail, discovering facts that pointed at a larger scheme of covert activities.  The McGovern campaign attempted to link the White House to the affair, but few found the accusation compelling.  Although Nixon maintained that he first learned of the Watergate cover up from White House Counsel John Dean in March 1973, the tapes prove that he knew about White House involvement in the break-in only six days later.  Rather than immediately fire the conspirators, Nixon ordered Dean to orchestrate a cover-up of the operation. It was the cover-up, which included pay-offs, offers of executive clemency, and pressuring the CIA to get the FBI to call of the investigation, that would be Nixon’s “fatal error.”  The cover-up worked well enough and in November, Nixon won in a landslide, losing only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. 

In January, federal district judge John Sirica found the five burglars, Hunt, and Liddy guilty. Still, the suspicion toward the legality of CREEP’s reelection efforts remained. On Feburary 7, 1973, the Senate voted unanimously voted to form the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities.  The Committee was given one year and a $500,000 budget to “conduct an investigation and study of the extent, if any, to which illegal, improper, or unethical activities were engaged in by any persons, acting individually or in combination with others, in the presidential election of 1972, or any campaign, canvass, or other activity related to it.” (Cite first episode) 	The senators selected for the Committee were chosen for their obscurity, their lack of ambition for higher office and their non-partisan reputations. It included four democrats, the Chairman Sam Ervin (D-N.C.), Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), Joseph Montoya (D-N.M.), and Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.), and three Republicans, Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), Edward Gurney (R-Fla.), and Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.). The Committee also had a team of attorneys and assistants including chief majority counsel Samuel Dash and chief minority counsel Fred Thompson.

The pressure building behind the Watergate dam developed its first crack on March 19 when Watergate burglar James McCord wrote to Judge Sirica claiming that the White House had bribed him to keep quiet.  The letter prompted Dean to lay out in excruciating detail to Nixon the extent of White House involvement. It was at this point that he recommended that Nixon attempt to eliminate the “cancer on the presidency” before it spread.  Members of the White House ran to protect themselves and as time went on, Nixon himself began to fear being connected with the cover-up.  On April 30, three members of Nixon’s inner circle, H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and Richard Kleindienst resigned, and John Dean was fired. That night, Nixon gave a speech on television claiming that he would personally investigate the matter.

### The Senate Watergate Committee

<a id="Phase-One"></a>

#### Phase One: Watergate

The public hearings began on May 17, 1973 with opening statements from the Senators and the testimony of one Robert Odle. Sam Dash, a law professor from Georgetown, was adamant that the Committee build its investigation with “small fish” before moving on to the “star witnesses” of Nixon’s inner circle. As a result, the two witnesses on the first day, Robert Odle and Bruce Kehrli, were low-rankers who explained the chains of command at CREEP and the White House respectively. The next witnesses, Sergeant Paul Leeper, Officer Carl Shoffler, James McCord, Bernard Barker, and Alfred Baldwin reported on the events of the break-in at the Watergate and CREEP bugging operations. With James Caulfield, Anthony Ulasewicz, Sally Harmony, and Robert Reisner, the Committee moved into investigating the cover-up including offers of executive clemency, destroyed files, and cash payments. Hugh Sloan, Herbert Porter, and Maurice Stans then described their role in securing and distributing money for the burglars and their families. The first witness on a higher tier of importance was Jeb Stuart Magruder, the former deputy director of CREEP who implicated many more people, including his boss, John Mitchell, and admitted to developing a substantial portion of the cover-up including cash pay-offs.

The first moment of substantial drama came with the testimony of John Dean, which subsequently became the standard against which all other testimony was judged.  In a calm, steady manner which belied the shocking information he revealed, Dean claimed that the President of the United States was involved in the cover-up as early as September 1972.  Senator Inouye later commented that he thought that no one believed Dean at first as “it was too fantastic.”  As his testimony went on, Dean revealed more and more information about White House practices including improper use of the IRS and campaign funds, the “enemies list”, and surveillance of politicians, including Ted Kennedy. But after five days of questioning, the Committee had done little to crack his opening statement regarding the President.
   
The next two witnesses, former Attorney General and director of CREEP John Mitchell and special counsel Richard Moore both contradicted Dean’s testimony, unequivocally stating that the President had no knowledge of Watergate until late March 1973. The two left the Committee in an apparent state of gridlock. At the end of the July 13 broadcast Lehrer asked,
   
>“Isn’t the Committee walking itself out on to a plank? How are they ever really going to resolve the question [of Nixon’s guilt] when you continue to have witnesses like Mitchell and Moore, compared to Dean and Magruder and all of these many, many things, where there’s no way to resolve them!”

The very next public hearing, in a moment of dramatic irony, that question answered. On Monday July 16, the Committee brought out a surprise witness, the unknown former aide Alexander Butterfield who without any flair or showmanship reported that Nixon had recorded all his conversations in the Oval Office. The Committee voted in executive session to request access to the tapes. This excitement over the tapes overshadowed the next few witnesses, Herbert Kalmbach, Fred LaRue, Robert Mardian, and Gordon Strachan, who continued to elaborate on the distribution of money, the cover-up, and the dirty tricks of CREEP and the White House. On July 23, “Watergate moved from the realm of political scandal to political crisis,” after Nixon refused to hand over the tapes and the Committee voted unanimously to serve two subpoenas, the first time Congress has subpoenaed a sitting President.

With the problem of the tapes continuing to hang over the Committee room, the senators moved on to their originally planned “star witnesses”: John Ehrlichman and H. R. (Bob) Haldeman, two of Nixon’s closest friends and advisors. Dash later commented, “John Ehrlichman came with his jaw strutting out, saying who are you to call me to account, I did everything for my President and my country and I was right. And he put the Committee on the defense.”  Haldeman, on the other hand, who had a reputation for harsh leadership (“Every President has his SOB and I’m Richard Nixon’s”) came in docile and helpful. Regardless of their respective personalities, both denied that they or President Nixon had done anything wrong. Haldeman added another wrinkle to the tapes battle when he reported that Nixon had allowed him to listen to some of the tapes, thereby undermining the validity of any claims of executive privilege. After Ehrlichman and Haldeman, the Committee retreated from White House insiders again to fill in gaps in the existing testimony. They began with current and former intelligence officials, Richard Helms, Robert Cushman, and Vernon Walters of the CIA, and L. Patrick Gray, former acting director of the FBI. Richard Kleindienst and Henry Petersen rounded out the investigation before the August break.

#### Phase Two: "Dirty Tricks"
The Committee reopened its doors to the public on September 24, but in a manner that left many, including a few Senators, feeling that the Committee had lost its purpose. The intended topic of investigation, improper campaign practices, or so-called “dirty tricks” seemed like small potatoes compared to the ongoing Constitutional Crisis precipitated by the tapes. Despite these concerns, the Committee plowed on. The first witness upon their return was E. Howard Hunt who rounded out phase one before the Committee moved on to phase two with Pat Buchanan, Nixon’s speechwriter and ideological advisor. The main witness, Donald Segretti, who along with Charles Colson had planned CREEP’s tricks against the Democrats, described and apologized for many of his actions. Two of his assistants Martin Douglas Kelly, and Robert Benz corroborated his testimony. The next two witnesses, John Buckley and Michael McMinoway, were undercover operatives in the Muskie and McGovern campaigns respectively. The following several, Frederick Taugher, Kenneth Hickman, Richard Stearns, and Frank Mankiewicz testified about possible malfeasance by the McGovern campaign, including a violent demonstration. November 6 included five more testimonies in public session and 30 affidavits introduced into the record detailing various other campaign pranks.

<a id="Phase-Three"></a>

#### Phase Three: "Campaign Finance"
The last phase of the hearings covered donations to the Nixon campaign that might have involved either quid pro quo deals, or pressure for favorable legislation. Energy during this period was at an all-time low, as both the public and the Senators focused their attention elsewhere. Stephen Hess, a frequent expert on NPACT’s broadcasts commented that the lack of interest was a shame as the Committee could most affect change with new campaign finance legislation.  To help illuminate the problem of ethical campaign contributions, William Marumoto, John Priestes, and Benjamin Fernandez reported on possible quid pro quo contributions. Then a representative sample of corporation officials came forward to say that they had been pressured to donate money to the Nixon campaign in exchange for legislative favor. The hearings closed on November 15.

### The Road to Resignation: Nixon’s Last Months
While the Senate Committee had been diligently detailing the small crimes and misdemeanors of campaign men, the case against Nixon had been rapidly building. On October 20, 1973, Nixon’s orders to fire the special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, resulted in the resignation of the Attorney General and his deputy, who refused to carry out the action as well as the eventual firing of Cox. This “Saturday Night Massacre,” as it came to be called turned public opinion further against the President.  It also prompted Congress to authorize the House Judiciary Committee to investigate Nixon’s crimes. On November 17, Nixon claimed “I am not a crook” at a press conference and on November 26, Rosemary Woods testified to erasing the 18 ½ minutes of missing tape. On December 6, Congress confirmed Gerald Ford as Vice President to replace Spiro Agnew who had resigned in October after charges of corruption.

Now three bodies, the Senate Watergate Committee, the new Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski, and the House Judiciary Committee were pursuing the Presidential tapes. The Senate Watergate Committee yielded to the other two. On November 27, the Committee decided to delay further hearings until after the Christmas break. On January 4, the President again refused to give the Committee tapes or honor their subpoenas. After two more sets of delays, on February 19, the Committee voted unanimously to hold no more hearings, allowing the country to focus on the special prosecutor.

As the House Committee dragged its feet, Jaworski “proved to be as tenacious a prosecutor as Cox,” sentencing seven of the President’s men to prison while continuing to pursue the tapes.  On April 30, Nixon released edited transcripts of the transcripts, rife with holes and “expletive deleted” redactions. Judge Sirica knew the tapes to be incomplete, and demanded the tapes themselves. When Nixon refused, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear the case in July. These proceedings roused the 38 members of the Judiciary Committee to action. On May 9, the Committee began hearing evidence. They voted that day to enter executive session, shutting out the press for the initial stages. In two months, the Committee resurfaced to begin Impeachment debates on July 24.  That day, the Supreme Court ruled that Nixon must hand over the tapes to Judge Sirica, which he did after a tense few hours.

Nixon’s late compliance could not stop the momentum that after so many months had built to a grand finale. After two days (July 24 and 25) of speeches from every member of the Committee, it was clear that the majority would vote for impeachment. On July 26, the Committee began discussing specific articles of impeachment, the first of which (obstruction of justice) they approved the next day. On July 29, the Committee added “abuses of power” to the first charge. During this time, the President’s lawyers were listening to the tapes, including the so-called “smoking gun” tape, a conversation between Nixon and Haldeman that revealed that the President knew about Watergate as early as June 23, 1972.  When it became clear that he would not survive an impeachment trial, he resigned on August 9, 1974, still scowling and unapologetic. Watergate had claimed its last victim.

#### Conclusion: Watergate’s Aftermath
There are two main ways of viewing the Watergate story. On the one hand, it could be seen as a story of the success of American democracy. Jim Lehrer later commented,

>“The way I would sum it up is that it’s good news, bad news situation. It showed the government of the United States at its absolute worst and then it showed it at its absolute best. It corrected a wrongdoing, a series of wrongdoings, that was unprecedented. But the way it corrected was also a series of unprecedented doings.”

Certainly the Congress and Supreme Court, in the method dictated by the Constitution corrected the excesses of an Imperial Presidency. On the other hand, Watergate is the start to a wave of American cynicism, leaving the lingering question of whether the crimes were simply business as usual. One teacher commented,

>“After Watergate, it’s crazy to have trust in politicians. I’m totally cynical, skeptical. Whether it’s a question of power or influence, it’s who you know at all levels. Nixon said he was the sovereign! Can you believe that? I was indignant. Someone should have told him that this is a democracy, not a monarchy.”

However Watergate comes out in the long run tabulation, it certainly represents a crucial inflection point in American politics that deserves our attention.
