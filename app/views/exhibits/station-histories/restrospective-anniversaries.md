The third type of content I'm interested in including in my exhibition is retrospective anniversary specials. Items to be included in this section include:

-	[WILL history of radio, early broadcasting, and the establishment of University of Illinois educational radio](/catalog/cpb-aacip_16-79v15q57), presented on the occasion of WILL’s 75th anniversary (and narrated by Jack Brighton!).
-	[Maine Public Broadcasting Network’s “20th Anniversary Scrapbook”](/catalog/cpb-aacip_245-214mwb7d) - In this program they go through the history of the network by decade. Each portion starts with a montage of very short bits of early programs, with no sound (voice over and music played instead), and followed by a long segment of a conversation between former staff members about the history of the network. 
-	[WBRA’s “Across the Blue Ridge: 20 Years of Public Television”](/catalog/cpb-aacip_85-85n8ptc3) – This program features interviews with many of the founding staff of the station, who still work there 20 years later. They go through the entire history with great anecdotes. The only problem is they use some short clips (most with voiceover narration played on top of any sound from the clip), so I have to check if that’s okay to put online. 
-	[KUT’s “30th Anniversary Dinner”](/catalog/cpb-aacip_402-70zpch1s) – This is a recording of a dinner celebrating 30th anniversary of station. Molly Ivins MCs. She introduces the evening and recognizes special guests. Then the general manager speaks on the history of the station. Then Bob Edwards, host of Morning Edition, speaks about public radio's unique contribution to radio.
