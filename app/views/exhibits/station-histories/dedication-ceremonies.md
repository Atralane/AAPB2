The second type of content I’m interested in including in my exhibition is dedication ceremonies for public broadcasting facilities. These are interested because they usually feature discussion of the station’s history, but also highlight the importance of the actual space and equipment used for broadcasting. Items to be included in this section include:

-	[Dedication ceremony of Arkansas’ new Educational Broadcasting Facility](/catalog/cpb-aacip_111-21ghx7d6), with speeches from many public broadcasters and politicians involved with getting AETN started. 
-	[Dedication ceremony of the KOCE/PBS SoCaL station](/catalog/cpb-aacip_221-76f1vwh1), with speeches by public broadcasters and politicians, and ends with short interviews with people in attendance. 
-	[Dedication ceremony of the WXXI facilities](/catalog/cpb-aacip_189-56n0319k), featuring an edited video tour of their whole space
-	[Dedication ceremony of the WNED facilities](/catalog/cpb-aacip_81-8380gndb), with presentation of colors and ribbon cuttings. 
-	[Dedication ceremony of Vilas Communication Hall, Wisconsin Public Broadcasting facilities](/catalog/cpb-aacip_30-89281bqr), made up of speeches by many involved, especially those at the University of Wisconsin, where the station is housed. 
-	I might also try to work in including [the announcement made after WGBH fire in 1960s](/catalog/cpb-aacip_15-19s1rwtr) in this section since it is also about facilities.
