## Summary

Climate scientists and activists have used the venue of public broadcasting to discuss and communicate the scientific consensus on human-driven climate change for more than a quarter of a century. They have repeatedly communicated the scientific consensus that climate change is human driven in interviews, call-in radio shows, debates, public lectures, and edited news programs and documentaries. Since the 1980s, an overwhelming number of scientists have warned that continued, unregulated emissions from the burning of fossil fuels will cause eventual catastrophic effects if actions to reduce and eliminate emissions are not taken during the ensuing decades. These warnings have gone unheeded by many policy makers and much of the American public. 

In the 1980s, the conversation around climate change focused primarily on the future threats of global warming. Now, people across the world are experiencing its devastating impacts. This exhibit highlights public broadcasting recordings of conversations on climate change -- its causes, impacts, and proposed solutions -- from 1970, the first year that Earth Day was celebrated, to the present.

## Main

"What will it cost the Earth?" asked environmentalist David Brower in a talk given at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, on April 19, 1970, just three days before Earth Day was first celebrated. Broadcast over the airwaves of the campus public broadcasting station WYSO-FM, Brower, who was the founder of the international environmental organization Friends of the Earth and the first Executive Director of the Sierra Club, urged the audience to educate and inform themselves on the environmental problems facing the country and the world. "You can make a difference," he argued.

Thirty-four years later, in 2004, Illinois Public Media (WILL) broadcast an interview with Dr. James Gustav (Gus) Speth, former Dean and Professor in the Practice of Environmental Policy and Sustainable Development at Yale University, an advisor on environmental issues to two presidents, and the chief executive officer of the United Nations Development Program. Dr. Speth attributed the successes of the environmental movement in the 1970s to the fact that environmental problems of that period were localized and "really in your face." Today's problems, Speth stated, "are global scale, they're more subtle...they're more technical." That people for the most part have had difficulty relating to the impacts of climate change has had a "crippling" effect on the environmental movement, Speth believed. 

For nearly a quarter of a century, there has been growing scientific consensus about climate change. Today, more than 97% of climate scientists agree that 1) the climate is changing; 2) humans are the primary drivers of climate change; 3) carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have reached unprecedented levels as a result of fossil fuel emissions; 4) continued emissions will cause severe, dangerous, and irreversible effects, and 5) global action to reduce and eliminate fossil fuel emissions needs to happen now to prevent the worst impacts. Communities across the world are already experiencing the devastating effects of climate change, including droughts, wildfires, floods, sea level rise, and stronger and more frequent storms. And while nearly all scientists agree on the issue of climate change, in 2014 only approximately 48% of American citizens understood that global warming is caused mostly by human activities. In January 2015, only half of United States senators voted in favor of an amendment to clarify that "human activity significantly contributes to climate change."

In 1988, climate scientist James Hansen, Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, became the first person to testify before Congress about the scientific consensus about and potential threat of global warming to the health, security and wellbeing of American citizens. His testimony brought the issue of global warming to the public eye and revealed the consensus among scientists that global warming was primarily caused by humans. 

Since that time, public broadcasting stations have recorded conversations about climate change in the form of interviews, call-in radio shows, lectures, debates, and edited news programs and documentaries. Featuring guests of diverse backgrounds including climate scientists, nationally recognized and local activists, journalists, artists, filmmakers, historians, policymakers, and writers, these conversations have covered the history of the environmental movement, the causes, impacts, and proposed solutions to climate change, government failure to dramatically reduce and eliminate emissions, and ways that ordinary citizens can make an impact in their communities and globally.
