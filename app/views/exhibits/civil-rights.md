## Summary

“Voices from the Southern Civil Rights Movement” presents educational and noncommercial radio programs from the 1950s and 1960s that offer historic testimonies – in interviews, speeches, and on-the-spot news reports – from many movement participants, both well-known and unknown. National leaders, local leaders, community organizers, students, clergy, lawyers, educators, academics, writers, and even a comedian and a documentary filmmaker relate their often riveting stories that document a range of individual and group experiences and perspectives. The collection presents accounts from a variety of locales, each a distinct piece of the complex history of the struggle to integrate the segregated South and achieve full citizenship rights for African Americans.

## Main

Fifty years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the legislative landmarks of the civil rights movement, the history of that movement is still being written. The importance of local accounts to enrich this history cannot be overemphasized. Emilye Crosby, a historian specializing in local civil rights studies, has written that the publication during the past two decades of a number of key works in local civil rights history, has “marked a major shift in the field.” Local studies, she writes, have “laid a foundation for reshaping movement history, for changing our understanding of many things, including chronology, the role of women, the significance of self-defense, the nature and persistence of white resistance, the failures of the federal government, the differences between long-term organizing and short-term mobilizing, the development of Black Power, the importance of economics and human rights issues, and the possibilities and limitations of nonviolent tactics and ideology.”

The programs presented in “Voice from the Southern Civil Rights Movement” explore many of the areas that Crosby identifies. Programs featuring [Rosa Parks](/catalog/cpb-aacip_28-kw57d2qp45), [Fannie Lou Hamer](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-bg2h70895r), [Ella Baker](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-125q814w5v), [Annie Devine](/catalog/cpb-aacip/15-9cj87k60), [Dorothy Height](/catalog/cpb-aacip/500-ff3m1j0m), [Constance Baker Motley](/catalog/cpb-aacip/500-z60c1503), help communicate the role of women in the movement, as do programs with less well-known activists such as [Priscilla Stephens](/catalog/cpb-aacip_28-br8mc8rr6z) of CORE and an unidentified [female high school student](/catalog/cpb-aacip/500-5q4rp59q) who participated in a Charleston, South Carolina sit-in. The significance of self-defense is addressed in ["An Integrated Project in Georgia"](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-mk6542jr2r). The nature and persistence of white resistence pervades many of these accounts, most prominently perhaps in ["The Negro Lawyer in the South"](/catalog/cpb-aacip_28-4t6f18sn70), ["Children of McComb"](/catalog/cpb-aacip_28-sj19k46b34), ["Kidnapping in North Carolina"](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-h707w67k6x), ["Mother's Day, May 12; Birmingham: Testament of Nonviolance, Part 3"](/catalog/cpb-aacip/500-ff3m1j0m), ["A Dialogue on Mississippi"](/catalog/cpb-aacip_15-945qgb91), and ["One Year Later in Mississippi"](/catalog/cpb-aacip/15-88qc028z). Failures of the federal government are expressed vehemently in ["Report from the South - James Bevel"](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-j09w08ws94). The significance of long-term organizing is addressed in ["Thirty Years of Civil Rights Educatoin in the South / Myles Horton"](/catalog/cpb-aacip_28-xp6tx35q0h) and ["Tribute to Ella Baker"](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-125q814w5v). The development of Black Power is discussed in ["Stokely Carmichael Interview"](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-zw18k75h85) and ["Handful that We are in Missississippi: A Spectrum of Opinion in Mississippi"](/catalog/cpb-aacip/15-9cj87k60). Assessments of nonviolent tactics and ideology are offered in ["The Battle is Not Yet Won"](/catalog/cpb-aacip_28-2z12n4zs1w), ["Ralph Gleason Interviewing Dick Gregory"](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-k649p2wm6m), ["Back to School in Birmingham; Birmingham: Testament of Nonviolance, Part 4"](/catalog/cpb-aacip/500-jq0svz1h), and ["Report from the South - James Bevel"](/catalog/cpb-aacip/28-j09w08ws94).
