<div class="page-header"><h1>Online Reading Room Rules of Use</h1></div>

<p>The American Archive of Public Broadcasting (the “AAPB”) is a project managed 
collaboratively by the WGBH Educational Foundation and the Library of Congress 
(“we” or “us”). The AAPB seeks to preserve and make accessible significant 
historical content created by public media, and the AAPB’s Online Reading Room 
(the “ORR”) plays a central role in our mission. In the ORR, you can view and 
listen to thousands of hours of digitized archival materials free of charge. We 
make the ORR and all content therein available in accordance with the copyright 
law of the United States, including the legal doctrine of fair use (17 U.S.C. 
107), for research, educational, and informational purposes only.</p>

<h2>1.  Authorized Users</h2>

<p>By using or accessing the ORR, you accept and agree to be bound by these Rules 
of Use (“Rules”). If you are using the ORR on behalf of an organization, you 
accept these Rules on behalf of your organization, agree that your organization 
is bound by these Rules, and represent that you have the authority to bind your 
organization to these Rules. In such cases, “you” and “your” refers to both you 
as an individual and your organization. We reserve the right to revoke your 
authorization to use the ORR in our sole discretion at any time.</p>

<h2>2.  Authorized Uses</h2>

<p>a.  The ORR is providing access to materials from the AAPB for research, 
educational, and informational purposes only. Use of the ORR content for any 
other purpose is unauthorized. You are authorized to use audiovisual content in 
the ORR for private viewing on a streaming, non-downloadable basis. We make no 
warranty with regard to the use of the ORR content for these or other purposes.</p> 

<p>b.  You are solely responsible for legal assessments regarding your use of any 
ORR content other than as explicitly authorized by these Rules, and for 
securing any legally required permissions for such use, such as may relate to 
intellectual property laws and rights of publicity and privacy.</p>

<p>c.  You may link to materials from this website without seeking permission as 
long as you properly credit the AAPB and the contributing organization as 
follows: [Title], [Date], [name of organization that contributed the materials 
to the AAPB], American Archive of Public Broadcasting (WGBH and the Library of 
Congress), Boston, MA and Washington, DC. Only other authorized users will be 
able to follow your link.</p>

<p>d.  If you use the ORR in connection with any research that results in a 
publication, we request that you credit the AAPB in your bibliography (if any) 
and that you include in the citation a unique AAPB web address for each AAPB 
record cited. The collection includes many similarly titled materials, so to 
ensure that future users can easily locate the records you have cited, we 
advise the use of unique AAPB web addresses.</p>

<p>e.  In using or accessing the ORR, you agree not to (i) act in any way that 
might give rise to civil or criminal liability, (ii) collect or store personal 
data about anyone, (iii) infringe any copyright, trademark, patent, or other 
proprietary rights of any person, (iv) violate anyone’s rights of privacy, 
publicity, or any other personal right, (v) interfere with the activities of 
any other user or of the AAPB, its servers, or resources, (vi) use or attempt 
to use any other user’s password to access the ORR, and (vii) harass or 
threaten anyone.</p>

<h2>3.  Rights</h2>

<p>a.  ORR content may be governed by local, national, and/or international laws 
and regulations, including intellectual property laws. Privacy, publicity, and 
other personal rights may also apply.</p>

<p>b.  The nature of ORR content often makes it difficult to determine the 
content’s copyright status. Though the AAPB tries when possible to provide 
information about copyright owners and related matters in catalog records, 
finding aids, and other texts that accompany collections or individual items, 
which may assist you in making necessary legal determinations, we make no 
representation or guarantee that such information is accurate, complete, or 
current. The absence of copyright information does not mean there is no 
copyright protection. ORR content may be protected by copyright even where we 
have not provided any rights information. The information we provide is not 
legal advice.</p>

<p>c.  In all cases, even those where we provide you with available copyright 
information, it is your responsibility to determine and satisfy all copyright 
and other use restrictions before making any use of ORR content not explicitly 
authorized by these Rules. Transmission or reproduction of protected items 
beyond that allowed by fair use or otherwise permitted by law requires the 
written permission of the rights holders. Securing such permissions may require 
the payment of fees. You must make your own assessments of rights in light of 
your intended use.</p>

<p>d.  We do not own rights to most of the material in the ORR collections. We 
therefore cannot grant or deny permission for any use of ORR content. Please 
keep in mind that we may be able to make greater use of ORR content than you; 
we may have rights to use and display ORR content that you may not.</p>

<p>e.  If you have rights-related or other information about an item you've seen 
on the AAPB, please contact 
<a href="mailto:casey_davis@wgbh.org">Casey E. Davis, Project Manager for the AAPB at WGBH</a>
with your contact details, the additional information, and a link to the 
relevant content, so that appropriate information may be provided to future 
users. If you provide us with any such materials, you grant us a non-exclusive, 
royalty-free, perpetual right to use those materials.</p>

<p>f.  If you are the owner of a copyright in ORR content and believe your work 
has not been properly attributed to you or has been used without permission, we 
want to hear from you. Please contact 
<a href="mailto:casey_davis@wgbh.org">Casey E. Davis, Project Manager for the AAPB at WGBH</a>
with your contact details, a link to the relevant content, and a 
description of the location of your copyrighted material within the content (if 
necessary). See our general <a href="/legal/tou">Terms of Service</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>4.  Password-Protected Uses</h2>

<p>a.  We may, at our sole discretion, provide you with a password to access 
certain materials not otherwise available via the ORR. In that event, this 
Section 4 shall apply to your password-protected use and access of the ORR.</p> 

<p>b.  You agree to supply all required information and comply with AAPB 
procedures in requesting password-protected access. You agree that any 
information you supply in connection with your request shall be accurate and 
complete.</p>

<p>c.  You agree to use your password only to access the materials for which it 
was granted. No other use of your password to access the ORR is authorized.</p> 

<p>d.  Your password is personal to you. You agree not to recirculate your 
password to any other people or organizations, and to report any breach in the 
security of your password, or its unauthorized use, promptly to 
<a href="mailto:casey_davis@wgbh.org">Casey E. Davis, Project Manager for the AAPB at WGBH</a>.</p>

<h2>5.  Liability</h2>

<p>a.  You agree to indemnify us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, 
officers, directors, trustees, and employees (collectively the “Indemnified 
Parties”) from and against any and all liability, loss, claims, damages, costs, 
penalties, and/or actions (including attorneys’ fees) if your use of the ORR 
creates any liability for the Indemnified Parties.</p> 

<p>b.  You are solely liable for any use you make of the ORR, and you agree to 
refrain from seeking indemnification from the Indemnified Parties if your use 
creates any liability for you.</p>

<h2>6.  Rules</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to modify the Rules at any time for any reason, without 
providing you with any notice. Your continued access and use of the ORR after 
any such modifications have been made will constitute your acceptance of and 
agreement to be bound by such modifications. Accordingly, please review the 
Rules regularly for updates.</p>
