# Contribute to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting

## Inventory & Catalog Records

We encourage all public media organizations and archives that hold public media materials to consider contributing inventory or catalog records to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB). Centralizing records in one national catalog will increase discoverability for researchers and help collection managers make informed preservation decisions. 

You may submit new and/or updated inventory records to be added to the AAPB catalog in the following ways:
- [*PBCore XML*](http://pbcore.org) 
- Send us a spreadsheet export from your database system
- Use this [*spreadsheet template*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/resources/pbcore_excel_template.xls) if you're just getting started with your inventory. Definitions of each field can be found on the [*PBCore website*](http://pbcore.org).

At the very least, your records should include a Unique Identifier, Title, and Date (Broadcast Date and/or Copyright Date preferred), but the more information you can provide, the better! All records (not the actual video or audio content) contributed to the AAPB catalog must be dedicated to the public domain under a [*Creative Commons 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0*)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.

## Content

The AAPB team at WGBH and the Library of Congress has begun to select additional video and audio content for future inclusion into the AAPB collection. Organizations seeking to contribute collections to the AAPB are asked to fill out our [*Collection Acquisitions Form*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/resources/AAPB_collection_acquisitions_form.pdf). Send your completed form to Casey Davis, AAPB Project Manager at casey_davis@wgbh.org. 

### Deed of Gift

The [*AAPB Deed of Gift*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/americanarchive.org/resources/AAPB_model-deed-of-gift.docx) is an agreement between the collection donor and WGBH and the Library Congress. It is a model deed of gift, which we are open to negotiating with donors, but a version of this agreement must be signed by all collection donors. 

Please contact Casey Davis, Project Manager, at casey_davis@wgbh.org if you have any questions.
