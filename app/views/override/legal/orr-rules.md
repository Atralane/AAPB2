# AAPB Online Reading Room Rules of Use

The American Archive of Public Broadcasting (the “AAPB”) is a project managed 
collaboratively by the WGBH Educational Foundation and the Library of Congress 
(“we” or “us”). The AAPB seeks to preserve and make accessible significant 
historical content created by public media, and the AAPB’s Online Reading Room 
(the “ORR”) plays a central role in our missio<strong>n.</strong> In the ORR, you can view and 
listen to thousands of hours of digitized archival materials free of charg<strong>e.</strong> We 
make the ORR and all content therein available in accordance with the copyright 
law of the United States, including the legal doctrine of fair use (17 U.S.C. 
107), for research, educational, and informational purposes only.

organization to these Rule<strong>s.</strong> In such cases, “you” and “your” refers to both you 
as an individual and your organizatio<strong>n.</strong> We reserve the right to revoke your 
authorization to use the ORR in our sole discretion at any time.

educational, and informational purposes onl<strong>y.</strong> Use of the ORR content for any 
other purpose is unauthorize<strong>d.</strong> You are authorized to use audiovisual content in

### 3.  Rights

<strong>3.a.</strong> ORR content may be governed by local, national, and/or international laws 
and regulations, including intellectual property law<strong>s.</strong> Privacy, publicity, and 
other personal rights may also apply.

<strong>3.b.</strong> The nature of ORR content often makes it difficult to determine the 
content’s copyright statu<strong>s.</strong> Though the AAPB tries when possible to provide 
information about copyright owners and related matters in catalog records, 
finding aids, and other texts that accompany collections or individual items, 
which may assist you in making necessary legal determinations, we make no 
representation or guarantee that such information is accurate, complete, or 
curren<strong>t.</strong> The absence of copyright information does not mean there is no 
copyright protectio<strong>n.</strong> ORR content may be protected by copyright even where we 
have not provided any rights informatio<strong>n.</strong> The information we provide is not 
legal advice.

<strong>3.c.</strong> In all cases, even those where we provide you with available copyright 
information, it is your responsibility to determine and satisfy all copyright 
and other use restrictions before making any use of ORR content not explicitly 
authorized by these Rule<strong>s.</strong> Transmission or reproduction of protected items 
beyond that allowed by fair use or otherwise permitted by law requires the 
written permission of the rights holder<strong>s.</strong> Securing such permissions may require 
the payment of fee<strong>s.</strong> You must make your own assessments of rights in light of 
your intended use.

<strong>3.d.</strong> We do not own rights to most of the material in the ORR collection<strong>s.</strong> We 
therefore cannot grant or deny permission for any use of ORR conten<strong>t.</strong> Please 
keep in mind that we may be able to make greater use of ORR content than you; 
we may have rights to use and display ORR content that you may not.

<strong>3.e.</strong> If you have rights-related or other information about an item you've seen 
on the AAPB, please contact 
<a href="mailto:casey_davis@wgbh.org">Casey E. Davis, Project Manager for the AAPB at WGBH</a>
with your contact details, the additional information, and a link to the 
relevant content, so that appropriate information may be provided to future 
user<strong>s.</strong> If you provide us with any such materials, you grant us a non-exclusive, 
royalty-free, perpetual right to use those materials.

<strong>3.f.</strong> If you are the owner of a copyright in ORR content and believe your work 
has not been properly attributed to you or has been used without permission, we 
want to hear from yo<strong>u.</strong> Please contact 
<a href="mailto:casey_davis@wgbh.org">Casey E. Davis, Project Manager for the AAPB at WGBH</a>
with your contact details, a link to the relevant content, and a

necessary). See our general <a href="/legal/tou">Terms of Service</a> for more information.

officers, directors, trustees, and employees (collectively the “Indemnified

penalties, and/or actions (including attorneys’ fees) if your use of the ORR 
creates any liability for the Indemnified Partie<strong>s.</strong>
