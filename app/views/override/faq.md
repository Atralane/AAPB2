##What is the American Archive of Public Broadcasting?

The American Archive is an initiative to digitally preserve and make accessible 
public broadcasting radio and television programming, ensuring its collection, 
management, preservation, and access. In August 2013, the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting selected WGBH and the Library of Congress as the permanent 
stewards of the American Archive collection.

<a name="what-is-available"></a>
##What is available on the AAPB website?

The initial launch of the AAPB website provides access to metadata records that 
were created during the American Archive Content Inventory Project. The records 
document the existence of 2.5 million public radio and television assets at 
more than 120 public media stations and archives across the country. Of those 
2.5 million assets, 68,000 were recently digitized for preservation and access 
in the AAPB. The 68,000 items total approximately 40,000 hours of video and 
audio. 

<a name="what-is-digitized"></a>
##How can I tell if something was digitized in the AAPB?

The website currently indicates the 68,000 video and audio items that were 
digitized in the AAPB project. To locate records for digitized items, conduct a 
keyword search, and using the facet menu on the left side of the search results 
page, expand the "Access" filter and click "Digitized."

##I want to conduct research using the AAPB collection now. How can I do so?

The entire AAPB collection, consisting of 40,000 hours of historic public 
television and radio programming and 68,000 items, is available for research at 
WGBH Educational Foundation in Boston and the Library of Congress in 
Washington, D.C. More information about on-location research policies and 
scheduling an appointment is available [here](/on-location). 

<a name="when"></a>
##When will video and audio in the AAPB collection be available online?

Digitized video and audio will be available in the AAPB Online Reading Room by 
October 2015. 

<a name="will-all"></a>
##Will all 68,000 items / 40,000 hours be available online?
 
No, the entire collection will not be available online due to rights and other 
legal restrictions; however, the AAPB Project Team is developing a strategy to 
clear rights and analyze content in the collection in order to make as much 
accessible in the Online Reading Room as possible. By October 2015, we hope 
that thousands of video and audio materials in the collection will be available 
in the Online Reading Room.

<a name="why-not"></a>
##Since it's public media, isn't it in the public domain?

No. Content in the AAPB may be protected by U.S. copyright law and its use may 
be subject to the permission of the copyright owner, content creators, 
performers, unions, or other third parties. Privacy and publicity rights may 
also apply. The nature of content in the AAPB often makes it difficult to 
determine the contentâ€™s copyright status. AAPB endeavors when possible to 
provide accurate factual information about copyright owners and related matters 
in catalog records, finding aids, and other texts that accompany collections or 
individual items that may assist patrons in making necessary legal 
determinations. 

<a name="reading-room"></a>
##What is the Online Reading Room?

The AAPB Online Reading Room, accessible beginning in October 2015, will 
provide access to digitized video and audio archival materials in the 
collection for research, educational, and informational purposes only. Patron 
uses will be restricted to those permitted under copyright law. 

<a name="license-reuse"></a>
##If I would like to license or reuse content in the archive, who do I contact?

It is your responsibility to determine and satisfy all copyright and other use 
restrictions before using content in the AAPB. If you have selected an item or 
items that you want to license for reuse, you should contact the contributing 
organization that is listed in the metadata record. 

<a name="not-digitized-access"></a>
##If I found an item on the AAPB website that I would like to view/listen to that wasn't digitized, how can I gain access to it?

If the item you found was not digitized, you can contact the contributing 
organization listed in the metadata record to find out if and how it can be 
accessed.

<a name="eligible"></a>
##Who is eligible to contribute to the American Archive collection?

Public TV or radio stations (or joint licensees); national public media 
organizations; producers for public media (e.g. PRI, ITVS); and repositories 
holding public media content are all eligible to contribute to the AAPB 
collection.

<a name="get-involved"></a>
##How can my organization get involved in the American Archive initiative?

The AAPB Project Team is currently working on a collection development policy 
to guide the growth of the collection and the workflows to add new metadata 
records to the catalog and accept new digital files for preservation and 
access. In the next few months we'll have a solid plan for growing the archive 
beyond the first 40,000 hours.

As a first step, we would suggest creating an inventory of your collection, if 
you haven't done so already, so that you can share your metadata records with 
the AAPB. If you're interested in templates for inventorying your collection, 
contact AAPB Project Staff at aapb_notifications@wgbh.org.

<a name="station-access"></a>
##I work at a participating organization. How can my station access our digital files and metadata records?

Participating organizations can use the Archival Management System (AMS), to 
view their records and digitized proxy files. We have created [guides](http://americanarchive.org/help/using-the-ams) for 
navigating the AMS and obtaining copies of your organization's improved 
metadata.
