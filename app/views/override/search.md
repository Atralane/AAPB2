# Searching the AAPB Website

The AAPB website consists of nearly 2.5 million metadata records, 68,000 of 
which describe video and audio content that has been digitized by the AAPB. The 
metadata records for all 2.5 million records are currently inventory-level and 
most have not been fully cataloged. The best way to find what you are 
looking for, or at least narrow your search on the AAPB website, is to conduct 
keyword searches in the search bar. Then, you can filter the retrieved results 
using the browsing options (facets) that appear on the left side of the search 
results page. If you come to the website not looking for anything in particular, check out the [Browse the Collection](http://americanarchive.org/#browse) section on the homepage for possible content to browse.

If you type keywords into the **SEARCH BAR**, you will be searching all of the 
fields in all of the records in the AAPB Collection. This is the most fail-safe 
way to search the collection because it will retrieve relevant results based on 
the data available, even if that data has not be entered into the correct field.

If you want to view everything that has been **DIGITIZED**, conduct a search and then click "All Digitized" under the "Access" filter in the facets menu on the left side of your search results.

From your search results, you can use additional **FACETS** on the left to filter 
your results.

Using the **MEDIA TYPE** facet, you can filter your results to show only 
Moving Image or Sound.

To filter your results based on their topic or format of the content use the 
**GENRE** or **TOPIC** facets; for example, Cooking, Arts, Nature, Talk Shows, and News Reports. 
Please note that not all records have been tagged with a Genre or Topic as cataloging is still in progress.

The **ASSET TYPE** facet filters results based on whether they are Episodes, Clips, 
Programs, Raw Footage, etc. Please note that Asset Types have not been added to all of the 
record, as cataloging is still in progress.

If you are looking for content contributed by a specific station or material from a specific state in the US, use the **ORGANIZATION** facet. With this facet you can filer 
your results based on which organization contributed the records to the AAPB 
collection, or a state. Clicking on a state will show all records contributed by all stations in that state.

The **YEAR** facet lets you filter your results based on the year or range of years. Please note that only 1/3 of AAPB records currently have dates, as cataloging is still in progress.
