## Public Broadcasting Core (PBCore) Metadata Dictionary project

In 2004, public broadcasters launched the PBCore metadata schema as a way for 
stations to record and share information about assets within their stations and 
among other public media organizations. PBCore provides stations and other 
organizations managing video and audio collections with a simple data model and 
XML schema for video and audio metadata.
